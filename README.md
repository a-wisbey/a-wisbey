- 👋 Hi, I’m @a-wisbey
- 👀 I’m interested in switching careers into Tech 👩‍💻
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git via the Terminal, brushing up on my HTML and CSS, and Javascript
- 📫 Reach me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abi-wisbey-96606ba5/
- ⚡ Fun fact: New to coding, but eager to make pixels dance on the screen! Currently learning the art of loops and the magic of if statements. My code might not be bug-free, but I'm on a journey of turning errors into lessons. Excited to see where this coding adventure takes me! 💻✨
